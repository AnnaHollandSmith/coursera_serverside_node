### Week 2

[Week 2 exercises](./week_2)

_This module looks in detail at data storage with MongoDB, the popular NoSQL database. Exercises and lectures cover the Express generator for scaffolding an Express application. Then you will learn about MongoDB. This module is expected to teach how to interact with MongoDB from a Node application as well as the Mongoose ODM to create schemas and models, and  how to interact with MongoDB server._

### Week 3

[Week 3 exercises](./week_3)

_This module is dedicated to user authentication. The exercises consist of developing a full-fledged REST API server with Express, Mongo and Mongoose. The module then progresses to examine basic authentication and session-based authentication briefly before developing token-based authentication with the support of JSON web tokens and the Passport module._
